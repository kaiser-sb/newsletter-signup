## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive web design

### What I learned

This was a very nice challenge where I had to link DOM manipulation with displaying of different sections - while keeping in mind the fact that things varied totally in different screen sizes. I faced a lot of mini challenges especially in desgn part - which were very rewarding after I figured out the solution.

### Continued development

I thought of using CSS Grid here but again ended up using flexbox. Probably I will try this with grid after a while - and I am thinking of applying some cool CSS effects, which I never tried my hands on.
